#### Are We Anti-Cheat Yet?

A website dedicated to keeping track of which games have committed to bringing anti-cheat support to GNU/Linux. This project was born out of the fact that I could not find a definite list or source of truth for games that are committing to full GNU/Linux support. So in the spirit of transparency and keeping these companies accountable, I decided to take it upon myself to found this project so that there actually a single place where this information is compiled into a single document, and is a trustworthy and reliable source.

## 🎉 Features

## 👍 I'd like to contribute to the list!

First, make sure that the game you'd like to add isn't actually on the list. In the event that it isn't, **make sure there isn't an issue for it already**, and then file a new issue and follow the template and fill out all the required fields.

## 📖 How does this work?

A list is maintained in [games.json](games.json).  
On a new commit, the website is automatically statically regenerated.
